  <h2> This is a section on  Bass fish </h2>
 
<p class="paragraph"> Bass fish lives in lakes.The word for fish in Latin is <i>Pisces</i>.  </p>

 <p class="paragraph"> Fish is a member of a paraphyletic group 
of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate
 animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition
 are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish,
 as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish are 
ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures 
to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large
 active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher
 core temperature.Fish are abundant in most bodies of water.
 They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high
 mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and
 even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., cusk-eel and snailfish).
 At 32,000 species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than
 any other group of vertebrates.</p>
